ABOUT ME
I am a physicist, software developer, and engineering team leader passionate about quantum computing
and cloud HPC. I received my Master’s in engineering physics at Cornell University, where my research focused on quantum machine learning, speciﬁcally quantum neural networks. As an undergraduate at Cornell, I studied physics and computer science and was a member of the varsity soccer team.
In addition to my executive role at qBraid, I am a maintainer and lead developer of the qBraid-SDK, qBraidQIR and an active code/community contributor to various other quantum open-source projects including
Qiskit, Amazon Braket, and PennyLaneAI. Professionally, I am driven to apply my experience across technical roles, program management, and deep tech strategic partnerships to grow the quantum ecosystem, and
accelerate research and development in the ﬁeld of quantum computing.
